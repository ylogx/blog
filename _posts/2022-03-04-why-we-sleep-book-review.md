## Review
I started reading this book last year. I read the first three chapters and that gave me a good enough idea that I stopped reading the book and started giving myself full 8 hour uninterrupted sleeping time. Now with a whole year of experiencing regular 8 hour sleep, as I finish this book I feel really good for picking this up in the first place.

Matthew Walker is a professor of neuroscience and psychology, runs a Sleep lab in UC Berkeley, has a twenty-plus-year of research career and the book is grounded in research. The tone at times gets very serious, given the ignorance of sleep in our life, that makes sense. The author tries hard to convince the reader to sleep enough hours and at least based on my experience, they were able to accomplish this goal.

Chapter 1 discuss sleep in general. Chapter 2 goes into circadian rhythm, sleep pressure, affects of caffeine, jetlag, etc. on our sleep. Chapter 3 goes into the details of sleep cycles, research, etc.

## Details
Personally, after starting the regular 8 hour uninterrupted sleep schedule, I have been able to wake up without any alarms in exact 7.5 hours daily. I have personally felt the effects of caffeine, as a results I stopped drinking diet coke and switched to decaffeinated coffee beans. Half life of caffeine is 5-7 hours ü§Ø, don‚Äôt drink caffeine, definitely don‚Äôt drink caffeine after 2-3 pm. The temperature schedule in thermostat to be lower at night and higher around the wake up time has also been super useful.

Understanding the architecture of sleep also comes in handy (Figure 8), a hypnogram. We sleep in 1.5 hour cycles where initial cycles are mainly filled with NREM sleep and the later cycles are filled with REM sleep. NREM sleep performs the work of weeding out and removing unnecessary connections. REM sleep is when we save our learning, strengthen the neural connections and dream. The last 1.5 hour section is when we get the maximum amount of REM sleep. We typically go into the waking stage around 3, 6 and 7.5 hour mark. This also means sleep hours aren‚Äôt equally divided, you can‚Äôt wake up early and finish your sleep by taking a nap. After fixing my sleep deficiency, I almost always wake up around the 6 hour mark (4*1.5hr) and I understand now and sleep more to finish the last 1.5hr part of the sleep cycle.

Understanding the 24 hour circadian rhythm of the superchiasmatic nucleus and the sleep pressure of adenosine has also come in handy (Figure 4, 5, 6). There‚Äôs genetic evidence for the chronotype aka night owl vs morning larks. It‚Äôs important to understand which one are you, not everyone benefits from waking up at 5 am, everyone definitely benefits from sleeping full 5 sleep cycles. Also, you can‚Äôt fix your sleep schedule by staying awake the entire night, trust me I‚Äôve tried, the book explains why. You have to shift your sleep schedule by slowly sleeping 0.5/1 hour earlier every day.

After reading the chapter about age and sleep, I started recommending my parents to also start sleeping full 8 hours. There were some great tips along those later chapters like what to do when you are sleepy and you have to drive, answer: DON‚ÄôT. There are tips about how to reduce sleep pressure but in general avoid driving in such situation. Drowsy driving vehicular accidents exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs. It‚Äôs crazy that we don‚Äôt see enough warning about lack of sleep as much as we see for alcohol.

It is great to combine this with ebook and audiobook. Each chapter can, for the most part, be read individually, and out of order, without losing too much of its significance. All the chapters are self contained and can be read in any order. Last few chapters are great candidates for listening via audiobook.

### Getting good sleep
* Understand circadian rhythm and sleep pressure relation.
* Lower temperature of the room to around 20C.
* Stick to a sleep schedule, even if you can‚Äôt, still give yourself 8 hours. iPhones have a great sleep schedule + DND feature.
* Sleeping 8 hours in parts is not the same as sleep for continuous 8 hours. First half is filled with NREM sleep, second half is filled with REM sleep.

## Quotes
* ‚ÄúThere does not seem to be one major organ within the body, or process within the brain, that isn‚Äôt optimally enhanced by sleep (and detrimentally impaired when we don‚Äôt get enough)‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe uneven back-and-forth interplay between NREM and REM sleep is necessary to elegantly remodel and update our neural circuits at night, and in doing so manage the finite storage space within the brain. Forced by the known storage capacity imposed by a set number of neurons and connections within their memory structures, our brains must find the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù between retention of old information and leaving sufficient room for the new. Balancing this storage equation requires identifying which memories are fresh and salient, and which memories that currently exist are overlapping, redundant, or simply no longer relevant.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA key function of deep NREM sleep, which predominates early in the night, is to do the work of weeding out and removing unnecessary neural connections. In contrast, the dreaming stage of REM sleep, which prevails later in the night, plays a role in strengthening those connections.‚Äù
