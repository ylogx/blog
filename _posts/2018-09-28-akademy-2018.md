This July I got the opportunity to be a part of the biggest gathering of KDE developers - [Akademy][akademy] [2018][akademy-2018].
The akademy conference gathers hundereds of KDE developers together for almost an entire week.

It was held at TU Wien (Techincal University of Vienna) in the beautiful city [Vienna][vienna-wiki], Austria from 
Saturday 11th to Friday 17th August 2018.

The akademy conference as usual has 2 days of talks by KDE contributors
followed by the rest of the week comprising of BoF informal sessions, team outing and a lot more.

<!-- 
BoF stands for birds of feather sessions.
For example in KDE India BoF, we talked about <!-- TODO: Add about india bof -->


## Talk: Containerizing KDE

At the conference [Anu][anu] amazing enough to let me be a part of her talk.
You should definitely go subscribe to Anu's [blog][anu].
We presented a [talk][containerization-talk-yt] regarding containerization of KDE applications.

In this talk we discussed various containerization techniques.
We also demonstrated how containerization of KDE can be useful for developers and end users.

### Overview
Setting up a development environment for a software can be time-consuming and at times a bit confusing.
There are many libraries and packages that need to be installed and which might also cause conflict with the existing system packages.
There are various ways to containerize an application, we discussed two major approaches - [Docker][docker] and [Flatpak][flatpak].


### Docker

[Docker][docker] helps a developer by setting up a sandboxed development environment in a container which can be used for debugging, testing or developing a new feature.
You can run multiple such environments in parallel e.g. stable & development environment.

#### Installing Docker

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
    
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce

sudo docker run hello-world
```

You can checkout more specific information on docker website [here][install-docker]

#### Running KDE applications using docker
KDE Neon is a project focused on building tooling to make it easy to run KDE applications on docker.

```bash
wget https://cgit.kde.org/docker-neon.git/plain/neondocker/neondocker.rb
chmod +x neondocker.rb
sudo gem install docker-api
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev

./neondocker.rb okular
```

You can find out more information [here][kde-neon-docker] about KDE Neon Dockerization.

### Flatpak

[Flatpak][flatpak] provides a sandbox environment in which users can run applications in isolation from the rest of the system.
Flatpak is tightly coupled with linux and mainly focuses on bundling and sandboxing of desktop applications on linux hosts.

#### Installing Flatpak

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexlarsson/flatpak
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flatpak
    
sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# sudo reboot now
```

You can checkout more specific information on flatpak website [here][install-flatpak]

#### Running KDE applications using flatpak

There is a [wide list][kde-flatpak-applications] of KDE applications available via flatpak.
To run an application like Okular, you need to run just one command:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists kdeapps --from https://distribute.kde.org/kdeapps.flatpakrepo
flatpak install kdeapps org.kde.okular
```
