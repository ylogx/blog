When working in multi node environment like Spark/Hadoop clusters, docker diminishes the barrier to entry. By barrier to entry, I mean the need to have a constantly running EMR cluster, when you are still in development phase. With Docker, you can quickly setup a 4-5 node cluster on a single machine and start coding your spark job. You can understand [what Docker is](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) and [why you would use Docker](https://www.docker.com/use-cases) on these links.

### Benefits
* You can very easily version control your environment
* Barrier to entry for working with clusters (Spark/Hadoop) etc. reduces a lot. You no longer need EMR access to run a cluster which will have a cost associated with it.

## Installing Docker
Follow [this official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)


#### Manual
Quickly for [ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce) steps are:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
sudo docker run hello-world
```

#### With Ansible
You can use following command to use ansible to install docker for you

```
sudo python2.7 -m pip install ansible \
  && sudo ansible-galaxy install --force angstwad.docker_ubuntu \
  && echo '- hosts: all
  roles:
      - angstwad.docker_ubuntu
  ' > /tmp/docker_ubuntu.yml \
  && sudo ansible-playbook /tmp/docker_ubuntu.yml -c local -i 'localhost,'
```


## Setting up a cluster
Follow [this post](https://bigdatagurus.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/how-to-start-spark-cluster-in-minutes/).

You will be able to run a local spark cluster with 4 commands.

#### Quick overview:

```
mkdir spark_cluster; cd spark_cluster

echo 'version: "2"

services:
  master:
    image: singularities/spark
    command: start-spark master
    hostname: master
    ports:
      - "6066:6066"
      - "7070:7070"
      - "8080:8080"
      - "50070:50070"
  worker:
    image: singularities/spark
    command: start-spark worker master
    environment:
      SPARK_WORKER_CORES: 1
      SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY: 2g
    links:
      - master
' > docker-compose.yml

sudo docker-compose up -d

# sudo docker-compose scale worker=2
```


## Extending other images
With docker you can build on top of someone else's image. For example, here I will extend `singularities/spark` image, make my custom spark configuration changes, and push the final version to my own docker hub repo.


### Pushing your changes to Docker hub
To create a fork from some base repo (singularities/spark), these are the steps

```bash
sudo docker run -it singularities/spark  # Run base repo. This will open a shell
# Make your changes to the image in this container
sudo docker login --username=chaudhary --password=lol
sudo docker commit <container ID from docker ps> chaudhary/my-repo-name  # Commit changes
sudo docker tag <image ID from docker images> chaudhary/my-repo-name  # Tag for pull to work properly
sudo docker push chaudhary/my-repo-name
```

Now that you have pushed this image, you can start a new container from this image as shown below:

```bash
sudo docker run -it chaudhary/my-repo-name
```
